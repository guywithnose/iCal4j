 RFC2445 Deviations
====================

 Most RFC2445 (iCalendar) implementations deviate from the specification in one
 form or another. These deviations may be a result of ambiguous or missing
 requirements, or just poor interpretation of the specification. Below we
 attempt to document known assumptions and deviations for specific RFC2445
 implementations.
 
 
 MS Outlook:
 
   - allows DATE-TIME representation without specifying a VALUE=DATE-TIME
   parameter

   - Outlook 2003 demands that the UID property must be present
   
   - provides quoted TZID parameters, and as such does not conform with RFC2445
   
   - generates additional spaces in recurrence rules containing a BYDAY
   component
 
 
 Mozilla Calendar/Sunbird:
 
   - long content lines are folded with a single LF character (should be CRLF)
   
   - folds all property parameters and values
 
   - Generates non-standard "X" properties
 
 
 phpicalendar:

   - long content lines are folded with a single LF character (should be CRLF)
 
 
 KOrganizer:
 
   - long content lines are folded with a single LF character (should be CRLF)
   
   - folds all property parameters and values
  
 
 Apple iCal:
 
   - uses VALUE=TEXT on some X-properties (NOTE: this is valid behaviour)
